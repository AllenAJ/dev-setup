# A Guide to setting up your developer environment

## Why?
When we were teaching ourselves how to code it took us some time, talking to more
 experienced developers and trying things out to **pick up on all the small things
  that make our lives easier as developers**.   
We wanted there to be a single place where new developers could go to find these quickly so they can **get past the setup and down to the business of coding**.

_Note: @dwyl we use full stack Javascript. This also includes some recommendations of things we personally favour of course!_

##Checklist
+ [ ] Get yourself a [text editor](#text-editor)
  + [ ] Do some [basic setup](#basic-text-editor-setup) to make your life a little easier

## Text Editor


### Basic text editor setup
+ ** Setting up [_soft tabs_](https://opensourcehacker.com/2012/05/13/never-use-hard-tabs/)** (indentation)
  + You can usually set this up in the _Preferences_ of your favourite text editor so you never have to think about it again (example below on [Atom editor](https://atom.io/))
