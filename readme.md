#A Guide to setting up your developer environment

##Why?
When we were teaching ourselves how to code it took us some time, talking to more
 experienced developers and trying things out to **pick up on all the small things
  that make our lives easier as developers**.   
We wanted there to be a single place where new developers could go to find these quickly so they can **get past the setup and down to the business of coding**.

_Note: @dwyl we use full stack Javascript. This also includes some recommendations of things we personally favour of course!_
